<h1><a id="Data_Keeper_0"></a>Data Keeper</h1>
<p>Data Keeper is a file storage inspired by <a href="https://github.com/yandextaxitech/binaryprefs">binaryprefs</a>. It does not uses caches(for now) and reads file directly from disk. Made for the ability to dynamically change encryption keys and verify the validity of keys during the creation of the Data Keeper</p>
